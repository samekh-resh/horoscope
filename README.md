### How Itâ€™s Made

<b>Langs used</b> HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript

First, I set up the html, putting in two input boxes and a button and paragraph tag for an explanation of the rules. Invisible, underneath the button, are two < p > tags, whihc are targeted in javascript to hold a message. With the css, I did a radial background and had it repeat over the screen, for aesthetics; I also centered the text for, again, aesthetics. 

Now with the javascript, this was just creating a simple, but elongated if/elseif statement. I knew that thprogram would be asking for the same information again and I knew that it would be easier to create an statement for each condition (twelve to be exact) that needed to be met. 

### optimizations

I think there is a simpler, more truncated, way of writing this code. I am still figuring out how. Please, feel free to play along.  

### Lessons Learned

This lesson was a little bit more positive, it just let me realize that conditional statements are really straightforward, and allow you to run through a plethora of choices to get a desired result. I think a lot in games, so It started making me ask questions of when you would use a  condition in video games.
